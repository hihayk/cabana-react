Work in progress build of the [Cabana Design System](https://cabanadesignsystem.com/) in React

# Take part in the Alpha Projects
- [See project doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-l3p8BzwHaukl3mhh8bSb5C1hVjb7MNuWFtS4xEfOj4/edit?usp=sharing)

# Basics:
- Using `styled-components` with `styled-system` under the hood.
- Working through each element of the design system and implementing a first round.

# Concepts to communicate:
- Out-of-the-box defaults are just for show. All using `defaultProps` to set this
- Use theme.js to customise values for the various parameters
- Use out-of-the-box components as you like
- Compose your own components by wrapping the pre-made ones
