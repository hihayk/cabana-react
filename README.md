# Take part in the Alpha Projects
We want to test the durability of the React version of Cabana. To do this, we want to try and implement (ie. code) something designed with the Sketch library, and see how the process feels. 

[You can take part here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-l3p8BzwHaukl3mhh8bSb5C1hVjb7MNuWFtS4xEfOj4/edit?usp=sharing), and share in the glory of Cabana-React!


## [Docs](https://cabana-react-docs.herokuapp.com)

**See the documentation at [cabana-react-docs.herokuapp.com](https://cabana-react-docs.herokuapp.com)** for more information about using `cabana-react`!

## Example: Your first Cabana component

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```JSX
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { Button } from 'cabana-react';
import myTheme from './theme.js';

const App = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
        <Button bg="primary" color="white">Hi!</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
);
```

This is what you'll see in your browser:
